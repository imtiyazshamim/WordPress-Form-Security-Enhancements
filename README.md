# WordPress-Form-Security-Enhancements
Enhance the security of WordPress forms and configurations with this collection of code snippets and best practices. Includes input validation, .htaccess security rules, client-side scripting, and WordPress configuration optimizations to protect against common vulnerabilities.

This repository provides essential steps to secure WordPress forms and configurations using cPanel. Follow these steps to apply the provided security code to your WordPress installation.

## Steps to Apply Security Code Using cPanel

### 1. Log in to cPanel
- Access your cPanel account through your hosting provider.
- Navigate to the **File Manager**.

### 2. Upload the Files
- Go to the **public_html** directory (or the folder where WordPress is installed).
- Upload the files to their respective locations:
  - **`function-new-validation.php`**: Place this in the theme directory (e.g., `/wp-content/themes/your-theme/`) or a custom plugin folder.
  - **`htaccess`**: Replace or edit the `.htaccess` file in the root directory of your WordPress installation.
  - **`script.js.txt`**: Rename it to `script.js` and upload it to `/wp-content/themes/your-theme/js/` or another appropriate folder.
  - **`wp-config.php`**: Only upload this file if it contains secure updates. Ensure database credentials and keys are correct before replacing.

### 3. Edit Files if Necessary
- Use the cPanel **Code Editor** to review and edit files as needed:
  - For `function-new-validation.php`, integrate the code with your theme or plugin’s `functions.php` file.
  - Update `.htaccess` rules to include or replace security directives.
  - Link `script.js` in your theme’s `header.php` or enqueue it using `functions.php`.

### 4. Set Proper File Permissions
- Ensure secure file permissions are set for critical files:
  - `.htaccess`: `644`
  - `wp-config.php`: `400` or `440`
  - Other PHP/JS files: `644`

### 5. Test the Configuration
- Visit your website to verify functionality after applying the changes.
- Test form submissions to confirm that validation and security measures are working correctly.

### 6. Backup and Monitor
- Create a backup of your site after making the updates.
- Monitor your site for unusual activity using cPanel’s **Error Logs** or plugins like Wordfence.
